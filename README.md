# Attempt at implementing Luca Palmieri's book [Zero To Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com) in Axum.
## I've lost about 2 months of work because I either forgot to commit or didn't do it somehow.
## Now I don't even know at what stage in the book this is on and I've lost all motivation to finish, so it is postponed indefinitly and unlikely to be resumed.
